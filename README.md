# BracketCraft

Site for creating and tracking course of tournament. Made with plain HTML + CSS + JavaScript.

It is my second web project, made in 3 days. It had to be simple. 

<hr>

## Functionality

Users can:

* create turnaments
* add teams participating in turnament
* view whole turnament bracket
* add match results for corresponding game

Other functionality:

* dynamicly generated brackets
* responsive design

<hr>

## Dependencies

* No dependencies, it is a plain HTML + CSS + JavaScript

<hr>

## Catalog structure

Done with Model-View-Controller (MVC) kept in mind. Even though it is overkill for web app without framework. For this reason there are no folders for: controllers, models, public (whole code is public so src is enough), config

<hr>

## What have I learned?

* I don't like JS
* degubbing JS
* working with JS
* how creating docs is made for apps
